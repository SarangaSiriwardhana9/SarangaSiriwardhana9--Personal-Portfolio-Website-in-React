          I am a BSc (Hons) Software Engineering student at the Sri Lanka
          Institute of Information Technology(SLIIT), with a passion for
          software engineering and a strong background in coding. My expertise
          lies in Java and Python programming languages, as well as web
          development. I am well-versed in various software development
          methodologies and eager to collaborate with dynamic teams on
          meaningful projects. My goal is to develop innovative solutions that
          address real-world problems, and I am constantly learning and
          improving my skills to achieve this.<br></br> Thank you for taking the
